	<p id="intro"> I am an SCPD student at <span>Stanford</span>, currently taking courses in the <a href="https://www-cs.stanford.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>. Before being an SCPD student, I worked in website conversion rate optimization, both at a public company that organizes the Kentucky Derby, <a href="https://www.churchilldownsincorporated.com">Churchill Downs Interactive</a>, and prior to that at a startup, <a href="https://www.healthtap.com">HealthTap</a>, that connects patients and physicians for online appointments. While being in coversion rate optimization I got exposed to building webpage variations to elicit a specific type of behavior from visitors, using A/B testing and personalization tools such as <a href="https://www.optimizely.com">Optimizely</a> and <a href="https://www.vwo.com">VWO</a>. Being exposed to the front-end side of websites sparked my interest in programming and Computer Science in general.</p>
	<p id="current"> I am currently making a career change from marketing to Software Engineering, and this is my third quarter taking classes at <span>Stanford</span>. A more detailed decription of my background can be found in my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/silviafernandezillescas">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>
	<p id="hobbies"> When I am not learning how to code I can be found:
		<ul>
			<li> Interval training at <a href ="https://redwood-city.orangetheoryfitness.com">Orange Theory Fitness</a>.</li>
			<li> <a href="https://www.expedia.com">Traveling</a>.</li>
			<li> Cooking.</li>
			<li> Spending time with friends & family.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p id="summer"> This Summer quarter, I am loving <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193c/">Client Side Internet Technologies</a> taught by <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~psyoung/">Dr. Patrick S. Young</a>. I am hoping to find a position as a Front End Software Engineer after completing this course.</p>
